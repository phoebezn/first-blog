## Techniques

### 3 different crosses
> Handling Terms – “Cross in front,” “cross behind,” and “blind cross,” refer to the handler’s position to the dog that is running the course.

There are 3 different way to switch one side of the dog to the other side. Front cross and blind cross are both in front of the dog, but blind cross is crossing without looking at the dog. Blind cross is supposed to be more efficient.
    - front cross
    - rear cross
    - blind cross

Rear cross out of the three is the one that needs more practice, because the dog may follow the handler and end up doing an extra turn. The first step is to practice with the dog when he's in sit stay position, and then let him jump after rear cross.

Front cross is easier because as long as the handler is doing it correctly, the dog most likely won't make a mistake. The key is to run faster so that the handler is ahead of the dog.

Generally, I can put a hand out and indicate the direction for doggie, the hand don't have to be moving a lot, almost like holding a can of paint and painting the path for doggie. The eyes should also be looking at the path of the dog. At the end of the sequence throw the toy with treats before the dog turn his head. There is a path for the dog and a path for human. 

### Rear cross 
1. [x] Start without jumps and make sure dog can sit stay while you rear cross

2. [x] Have dog sit stay in front of a jump and rear cross and release the dog and let him jump

3. [x] Enter with an angle so that the dog knows where to go
4. [x] Add more jumps before and after
5. [ ] more practice with a target (treats) at the end of the sequence, instead of being in the handler's hand

### Weaves
1. [x] Instead of luring the dog with treats, put a bowl with treats at the end of the weave poles and use leash to make sure the dog is running on the right track
2. [x] The dog always enter with the first pole next to the left shoulder

3. [ ] Start with fewer poles and progress to 12 poles in total
4. [ ] Add speed, work with chanel weave

## Questions
- Should I use clicker in agility training?
    
  - Maybe, since people can also use marker word instead of clicker in training. I'll use "Yes" as the marker word for now.
  
- Should I get a pull tab?

  - Yes, but not necessary
